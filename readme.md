# React test task

I`m used vite bundler for this project. It was good opportunity for me to try it on practice. It turns out very fast and includes many useful functions like code splitting from out the box;

## Instructions for starting project
#### Firstly run 
```sh
npm i
```
#### For starting with development envieroment values and live server execute 

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### For starting with production envieroment values
```sh
npm run build
```

and then 
```sh
npm run preview
```

#### Also i did dockerfile, for start in docker container run those two comands

```sh
npm run docker-build
```

and then 
```sh
npm run docker-start
```

It will be available on 80 port. http://localhost will be enough.

#### For run tests execute

```sh
npm run test
```
